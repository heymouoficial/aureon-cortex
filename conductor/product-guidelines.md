# Product Guidelines: Multiversa Lab

## Tone and Voice
The Multiversa Lab project will adopt a hybrid tone and voice across its various applications and communications, tailored to the specific context while maintaining overall clarity and user-centricity.

*   **Professional and Reliable:** For topics concerning finance (e.g., CalculaTú) and automation, the communication will be professional and trustworthy, instilling confidence and credibility.
*   **Visionary:** When discussing the broader ecosystem and future outlook of Multiversa Lab, the tone will be visionary and forward-looking, inspiring engagement and highlighting innovation.
*   **Warm and Supportive:** For applications focused on well-being and consciousness (e.g., HeyMode), the tone will be warm, empathetic, and supportive, fostering a sense of connection and guidance.

## Language
All communications will use clear, neutral Spanish, actively avoiding unnecessary technical jargon to ensure accessibility and understanding for a broad audience.
